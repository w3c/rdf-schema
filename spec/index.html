  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>RDF Schema provides a data-modelling vocabulary for RDF data.
    It is complemented by several companion documents which
    describe the basic concepts and abstract syntax of RDF
    [[RDF12-CONCEPTS]], the formal semantics of RDF [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]], and
    various concrete syntaxes for RDF, such as Turtle [[RDF12-TURTLE]],
    TriG, [[RDF12-TRIG]], and JSON-LD [[JSON-LD11]]. The RDF Primer
    [[RDF12-PRIMER]] provides an informal introduction and
    examples of the use of the concepts specified in this document.</p>
  <p>This document is intended to provide a clear specification of RDF
    Schema to those who find the formal semantics
    specification [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]]
    daunting. Thus, this document duplicates material also specified in the
    RDF
    Semantics specification. Where there is disagreement between this
    document
    and the RDF Semantics specification, the RDF Semantics specification
    should
    be taken to be correct.</p>

  <p>
    RDF Schema is a <a data-cite="RDF12-SEMANTICS#semantic-extensions-and-entailment-regimes">semantic
      extension</a> of RDF. It provides mechanisms for describing groups of
    related resources and the relationships between these resources. RDF
    Schema is written in RDF
    using the terms described in this document. These resources are used to
    determine characteristics of other resources, such as the <a href="#ch_domain">domains</a>
    and <a href="#ch_range">ranges</a> of properties.
  </p>
  <p>The RDF Schema class and property system is similar to the type
    systems of object-oriented programming languages such as Java. RDF
    Schema differs from many such systems in that instead of defining a
    class in
    terms of the properties its instances may have, RDF Schema
    describes properties in terms of the classes of
    resource to which they apply. This is the role of the <a href="#ch_domain">domain</a>
    and <a href="#ch_range">range</a>
    mechanisms described in this specification. For example, we could
    define the <code>eg:author</code> property to have a domain of <code>eg:Document</code>
    and a range of
    <code>eg:Person</code>, whereas a classical object oriented system might
    typically define a class <code>eg:Book</code> with an attribute called
    <code>eg:author</code> of type <code>eg:Person</code>. Using the RDF
    approach, it is easy for others to subsequently define additional
    properties with a domain of eg:<code>Document</code> or a range of
    <code>eg:Person</code>. This can be done without the need to re-define
    the original description of
    these classes. One benefit of the RDF property-centric approach is that
    it
    allows anyone to extend the description of existing resources, one of
    the
    architectural principles of the Web [[RDF-NOT]].</p>
  <p>This specification does not attempt to enumerate all the possible forms
    of
    representing the meaning of RDF
    classes and properties. Instead, the RDF Schema strategy is
    to acknowledge that there are many techniques through which the meaning
    of
    classes and properties can be described. Richer vocabulary or 'ontology'
    languages such as OWL [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]], inference rule
    languages and other formalisms (for example temporal logics) will each
    contribute to our ability to capture meaningful generalizations about
    data in
    the Web.</p>

  <p>The language defined in this specification consists of a collection of
    RDF resources that can be used to describe other RDF resources in
    application-specific RDF vocabularies. The core vocabulary is defined in
    a namespace informally called <code>rdfs</code> here. That namespace is
    identified by the IRI</p>

  <blockquote>
    <code>http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#</code>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and is conventionally associated with the prefix <code>rdfs:</code>. This
    specification also uses the prefix
    <code>rdf:</code> to refer to the RDF namespace</p>

  <blockquote>
    <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#</code>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For convenience and readability, this specification uses an abbreviated
    form to represent IRIs. A name of the form prefix:suffix should be
    interpreted as a IRI consisting of the IRI associated
    with the prefix concatenated with the suffix.</p>

<section id="ch_classes">
  <h2>Classes</h2>
  <p>Resources may be divided into groups called classes. The members of a
    class are known as <em>instances</em> of the class. Classes are
    themselves
    resources. They are often identified by <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#section-IRIs">IRIs</a>
    and
    may be described using RDF properties. The <code><a href="#ch_type">rdf:type</a></code>
    property may be used to state that a
    resource is an instance of a class.</p>
  <p>RDF distinguishes between a class and the set of its instances.
    Associated
    with each class is a set, called the class extension of the class, which
    is
    the set of the instances of the class. Two classes may have the same set
    of
    instances but be different classes. For example, the tax office may
    define
    the class of people living at the same address as the editor of this
    document. The Post Office may define the class of people whose address
    has
    the same zip code as the address of the author. It is possible for these
    classes to have exactly the same instances, yet to have different
    properties.
    Only one of the classes has the property that it was defined by the tax
    office, and only the other has the property that it was defined by the
    Post
    Office.</p>
  <p>A class may be a member of its own class extension and may be an
    instance of itself. </p>
  <p>The group of resources that are RDF Schema classes is itself a class
    called <a href="#ch_class"><code>rdfs:Class</code></a>.</p>
  <p id="def-subclass">
    If a class C is a <em>subclass</em> of a class C', then all instances
    of C will
    also be instances of C'. The <a href="#ch_subclassof"><code>rdfs:subClassOf</code></a>
    property may be used to state that one class is a subclass of another.
    The term super-class is used as the inverse of subclass. If a class C'
    is a super-class of a class C, then all instances of C are also
    instances of C'.
  </p>
  <p>The RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax [[RDF12-CONCEPTS]] specification
    defines the RDF concept of an <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#section-Datatypes">RDF

  <h2>Using the Domain and Range vocabulary</h2>
  <p>This specification introduces an RDF vocabulary for describing the
    meaningful use of properties and classes in RDF data. For example, an
    RDF
    vocabulary might describe limitations on the types of values that are
    appropriate for some property, or on the classes to which it makes sense
    to
    ascribe such properties.</p>
  <p>RDF Schema provides a mechanism for describing this information, but
    does not say whether or how an application should use it. For example,
    while an RDF vocabulary can assert that an <code>author</code> property
    is used to
    indicate resources that are instances of the class <code>Person</code>,
    it
    does not say whether or how an application should act in processing that
    range information. Different applications will use this information in
    different ways. For example, data checking tools might use this to help
    discover errors in some data set, an interactive editor might suggest
    appropriate values, and a reasoning application might use it to infer
    additional information from instance data.</p>
  <p>RDF vocabularies can describe relationships between vocabulary items
    from
    multiple independently developed vocabularies. Since IRIs are used
    to identify classes and properties on the Web, it is possible to create
    new
    properties that have a <code>domain</code> or <code>range</code> whose
    value
    is a class defined in another namespace.</p>

  <h2>Other vocabulary</h2>
  <p>Additional classes and properties, including constructs for

    containers and RDF statements, and for deploying RDF vocabulary
    descriptions
    in the World Wide Web, are defined in this section.</p>

    <h3>Container Classes and Properties</h3>
    <p>RDF containers are resources that are used to represent collections.
      The same resource may appear in a container more than
      once. Unlike containment in the physical world, a container may be
      contained in itself.</p>
    <p>Three different kinds of container are defined. Whilst the formal
      semantics [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]] of all three classes of container are
      identical,
      different classes may be used to indicate informally further
      information. An rdf:Bag is used to indicate that the container is
      intended to be unordered. An rdf:Seq is used to indicate that the
      order indicated by the numerical order of the <a href="#ch_containermembershipproperty">container
        membership properties</a>
      of the container is intended to be significant. An rdf:Alt container
      is used
      to indicate that typical processing of the container will be to select
      one of
      the members.</p>
    <p>Just as a hen house may have the property that it is made of wood,
      that
      does not mean that all the hens it contains are made of wood, a
      property of a
      container is not necessarily a property of all of its members.</p>
    <p>RDF containers are defined by the following classes and properties.</p>

<p>The 1999 RDF Model and Syntax Specification [[RDF12-XML-19990222]] defined a vocabulary for describing RDF statements without stating them. 
The 2004 RDF specification did not assign a normative formal semantics to this vocabulary.  However, an intended meaning of 
this vocabulary (which generally clarifies the intent of the RDF XML Syntax definition) is described here.
An informal introduction to the reification vocabulary, with examples, may be found in the <a

    <p>In addition to these classes and properties, RDF also uses properties
      called <code>rdf:_1</code>, <code>rdf:_2</code>, <code>rdf:_3</code>...
      etc.,
      each of which is both a sub-property of <code>rdfs:member</code> and
      an
      instance of the class <code>rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty</code>.
      There is
      also an instance of <code>rdf:List</code> called <code>rdf:nil</code>
      that is
      an empty <code>rdf:List</code>.</p>

    <h3>Acknowledgements for RDF 1.1</h3>
    <p>The current specification is largely an editorial
      clarification of that design, and has benefited greatly from the hard
      work of
      the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/">RDF Core Working Group</a>
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#Membership">members</a>, and
      from
      implementation feedback from many members of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/Interest/">RDF
        Interest Group</a>. In
      2013-2014 Guus Schreiber edited this document on behalf of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/">RDF
        Working Group</a>
      to bring it in line with the RDF 1.1 specifications.</p>

  <h2>Change since 2004 Recommendation</h2>
  <p>Changes for RDF 1.1 Recommendation</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Conversion to ReSpec, including formatting of examples and notes.</li>
    <li>References to RDF 1.0 documents where appropriate
      replaced by references to RDF 1.1 documents.</li>
    <li>Replaced the term "URI Reference" with the term "IRI". </li>
    <li>Removed discussion about distinction between plain and typed
      literals, as this distinction is absent in RDF 1.1 and has no
      technical bearing on RDF Schema.</li>
    <li>Removed the introductory paragraph of Sec. <a href="#ch_reificationvocab">"Reification
        Vocabulary"</a>, as this discussion is not related to the
      technical content and is irrelevant and confusing now. </li>
    <li>Update of affiliation of the editors. </li>
    <li>Added RDF WG to the Acknowledgements section.</li>
    <li>Renamed the document from "RDF Vocabulary Description Language
      1.0: RDF Schema" to "RDF Schema 1.1", as the term Vocabulary
      Description Language has led to confusion.</li>
    <li>Three paragraphs of the Introduction were left out. These
      paragraphs described the things that RDF Schema does not do and are
      now much less relevant than in 2004. </li>
    <li>Added the datatypes <code>rdf:langString</code> and <code>rdf:HTML</code>.
    </li>
    <li>Removed Appendix "RDF Schema in RDF/XML". It was informative, but
      now out of date, in terms of content and in terms of
  syntax.</li>
    <li>Marked <code>rdf:HTML</code> and <code>rdf:XMLLiteral</code>
        as non-normative.</li>
    <li>Removed references to 2004 Primer from Secs. 5.1, 5.2
        and 5.4.3. In the latter case the example referred to was
        moved into this document for readability purposes. </li>
