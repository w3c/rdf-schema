  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>RDF Schema provides a data-modelling vocabulary for RDF data.
    It is complemented by several companion documents which
    describe the basic concepts and abstract syntax of RDF
    [[RDF12-CONCEPTS]], the formal semantics of RDF [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]], and
    various concrete syntaxes for RDF, such as Turtle [[RDF12-TURTLE]],
    TriG, [[RDF12-TRIG]], and JSON-LD [[JSON-LD11]]. The RDF Primer
    [[RDF12-PRIMER]] provides an informal introduction and
    examples of the use of the concepts specified in this document.</p>
  <p>This document serves two complementary purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It defines RDF Schema as a vocabulary for specifying lightweight 
    ontologies, underlying the semantic extension described in 
    RDF Semantics (§9 of [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]]).</li>
    <li>It enumerates all terms defined within the <code>rdf:</code> and 
    <code>rdfs:</code> namespaces, including both terms relevant to 
    ontology construction and general-purpose terms used broadly within 
    RDF applications.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This document is intended to provide a clear specification of RDF
    Schema to those who find the formal semantics
    specification [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]]
    daunting. Thus, this document duplicates material also specified in the
    RDF
    Semantics specification. Where there is disagreement between this
    document
    and the RDF Semantics specification, the RDF Semantics specification
    should
    be taken to be correct.</p>

  <p>
    RDF Schema is a <a data-cite="RDF12-SEMANTICS#semantic-extensions-and-entailment-regimes">semantic
      extension</a> of RDF. It provides mechanisms for describing groups of
    related resources and the relationships between these resources. RDF
    Schema is written in RDF
    using the terms described in this document. These resources are used to
    determine characteristics of other resources, such as the <a href="#ch_domain">domains</a>
    and <a href="#ch_range">ranges</a> of properties.
  </p>
  <p>The RDF Schema class and property system is similar to the type
    systems of object-oriented programming languages such as Java. RDF
    Schema differs from many such systems in that instead of defining a
    class in
    terms of the properties its instances may have, RDF Schema
    describes properties in terms of the classes of
    resource to which they apply. This is the role of the <a href="#ch_domain">domain</a>
    and <a href="#ch_range">range</a>
    mechanisms described in this specification. For example, we could
    define the <code>eg:author</code> property to have a domain of <code>eg:Document</code>
    and a range of
    <code>eg:Person</code>, whereas a classical object oriented system might
    typically define a class <code>eg:Book</code> with an attribute called
    <code>eg:author</code> of type <code>eg:Person</code>. Using the RDF
    approach, it is easy for others to subsequently define additional
    properties with a domain of <code>eg:Document</code> or a range of
    <code>eg:Person</code>. This can be done without the need to re-define
    the original description of
    these classes. One benefit of the RDF property-centric approach is that
    it
    allows anyone to extend the description of existing resources, one of
    the
    architectural principles of the Web [[RDF-NOT]].</p>
  <p>However, RDF Schema also includes numerous terms in the <cite>rdf:</cite> 
    and <cite>rdfs:</cite> namespaces that support broader RDF functionality 
    and general data representation needs. These terms are not exclusively 
    tied to ontology specification but serve essential roles in RDF’s 
    broader architecture.</p>
  <p>This specification does not attempt to enumerate all the possible forms
    of
    representing the meaning of RDF
    classes and properties. Instead, the RDF Schema strategy is
    to acknowledge that there are many techniques through which the meaning
    of
    classes and properties can be described. Richer vocabulary or 'ontology'
    languages such as OWL [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]], inference rule
    languages and other formalisms (for example temporal logics) will each
    contribute to our ability to capture meaningful generalizations about
    data in
    the Web.</p>

  <p>The language defined in this specification consists of a collection of
    RDF resources that can be used to describe other RDF resources in
    application-specific RDF vocabularies. The core vocabulary is defined in
    a namespace informally called <code>rdfs</code> here. 
    <p>The IRIs in an RDF vocabulary often begin with
      a common substring known as a namespace <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr>.
      Some namespace IRIs are associated by convention with a short name
      known as a namespace prefix.

    </p>
    <table id="tab-vocab-ns" class="simple">
      <caption>Some namespace prefixes and IRIs used in this specification</caption>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Namespace prefix</th>
        <th>Namespace <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>rdf</td>
        <td><a href="https://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"><code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#</code></a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>rdfs</td>
        <td><a href="https://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"><code>http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#</code></a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>xsd</td>
        <td><a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"><code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#</code></a></td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

  <p>For convenience and readability, this specification uses an abbreviated
    form to represent IRIs. A name of the form <code>prefix:suffix</code> should be
    interpreted as a IRI consisting of the IRI associated
    with the <code>prefix</code> concatenated with the <code>suffix</code>.</p>

  <h2>Data-modelling vocabulary</h2>
  <section id="ch_vocab_classes">
  <h3>Classes</h3>
    <p>Resources may be divided into groups called classes. The members of a
      class are known as <em>instances</em> of the class. Classes are
      themselves
      resources. They are often identified by <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#section-IRIs">IRIs</a>
      and
      may be described using RDF properties. The <a href="#ch_type"><code>rdf:type</code></a>
      property may be used to state that a
      resource is an instance of a class.</p>
    <p>RDF distinguishes between a class and the set of its instances.
      Associated
      with each class is a set, called the class extension of the class, which
      is
      the set of the instances of the class. Two classes may have the same set
      of
      instances but be different classes. For example, the tax office may
      define
      the class of people living at the same address as the editor of this
      document. The Post Office may define the class of people whose address
      has
      the same zip code as the address of the author. It is possible for these
      classes to have exactly the same instances, yet to have different
      properties.
      Only one of the classes has the property that it was defined by the tax
      office, and only the other has the property that it was defined by the
      Post
      Office.</p>
    <p>A class may be a member of its own class extension and may be an
      instance of itself. </p>
    <p>The group of resources that are RDF Schema classes is itself a class
      called <a href="#ch_class"><code>rdfs:Class</code></a>.</p>
    <p id="def-subclass">
      If a class <var>C</var> is a <em>subclass</em> of a class <var>C'</var>, then all instances
      of <var>C</var> will
      also be instances of <var>C'</var>. The <a href="#ch_subclassof"><code>rdfs:subClassOf</code></a>
      property may be used to state that one class is a subclass of another.
      The term super-class is used as the inverse of subclass. If a class <var>C'</var>
      is a super-class of a class <var>C</var>, then all instances of <var>C</var> are also
      instances of <var>C'</var>.
    </p>
    <p>The RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax [[RDF12-CONCEPTS]] specification
      defines the RDF concept of an <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#section-Datatypes">RDF

    <p>The RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax specification [[RDF12-CONCEPTS]]
      describes the concept of an RDF property as a relation between subject

    <p id="def-subproperty">
      This specification defines the concept of subproperty. The <a href="#ch_subclassof"><code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code></a>
      property may be used to state that one property is a subproperty of

      If a property <var>P</var> is a subproperty of property <var>P'</var>, then all pairs of
      resources which are related by <var>P</var> are also related by <var>P'</var>. The term
      super-property is often
      used as the inverse of subproperty. If a property <var>P'</var> is a super-property
      of a property <var>P</var>, then all pairs of resources which are related by <var>P</var> are
      also related by <var>P'</var>. This specification does not define a top
      property that is the super-property of all properties.

      The basic facilities provided by <a href="#ch_domain"><code>rdfs:domain</code></a>

      and <a href="#ch_range"><code>rdfs:range</code></a> with sub-property

    <h3>Using the Domain and Range vocabulary</h3>
    <p>This specification introduces an RDF vocabulary for describing the
      meaningful use of properties and classes in RDF data. For example, an
      RDF
      vocabulary might describe limitations on the types of values that are
      appropriate for some property, or on the classes to which it makes sense
      to
      ascribe such properties.</p>
    <p>RDF Schema provides a mechanism for describing this information, but
      does not say whether or how an application should use it. For example,
      while an RDF vocabulary can assert that an <code>author</code> property
      is used to
      indicate resources that are instances of the class <code>Person</code>,
      it
      does not say whether or how an application should act in processing that
      range information. Different applications will use this information in
      different ways. For example, data checking tools might use this to help
      discover errors in some data set, an interactive editor might suggest
      appropriate values, and a reasoning application might use it to infer
      additional information from instance data.</p>
    <p>RDF vocabularies can describe relationships between vocabulary items
      from
      multiple independently developed vocabularies. Since IRIs are used
      to identify classes and properties on the Web, it is possible to create
      new
      properties that have a <code>domain</code> or <code>range</code> whose
      value
      is a class defined in another namespace.</p>

  <h2>RDF Collections</h2>
  <p>RDF containers are open in the sense that the core RDF specifications
    define no mechanism to state that there are no more members. The RDF
    Collection vocabulary of classes and properties can describe a closed
    collection, i.e. one that can have no more members.</p>
  <p>A collection is represented as a list of items, a representation that
    will be familiar to those with experience of Lisp and similar
    programming languages. There is a <a data-cite="RDF12-TURTLE#collections">shorthand
      notation</a> in the Turtle syntax specification for representing
    collections.</p>
  <p class="note">
    RDFS does not require that there be only one first element of a
    list-like structure, or even that a list-like structure have a first
    element.
  </p>

<!-- from Semantics doc -->

   <p>RDF provides a vocabulary for describing collections, i.e.'list
      structures', in terms of head-tail links. Collections differ from
      containers in allowing branching structure and in having an
      explicit terminator, allowing applications to determine the exact
      set of items in the collection.</p>


    <p>As with containers, no special semantic conditions are imposed on this vocabulary
      other than the type of <code>rdf:nil</code> being <code>rdf:List</code>. It
      is intended for use typically in a context where a container is described using
      blank nodes to connect a 'well-formed' sequence of items, each described by
      two triples of the form
      <code><br>
      <br>
      _:c1 rdf:first aaa .<br>
      _:c1 rdf:rest _:c2 .</code></p>

    <p>where the final item is indicated by the use of <code>rdf:nil</code> as the
      value of the property <code>rdf:rest</code>. In a familiar convention, <code>rdf:nil</code>
      can be thought of as the empty collection. Any such graph amounts to an assertion
      that the collection exists, and since the members of the collection can be determined
      by inspection, this is often sufficient to enable applications to determine
      what is meant. The semantics does not require any collections
      to exist other than those mentioned explicitly in a graph (and the empty collection).
      For example, the existence of a collection containing two items does not automatically
      guarantee that the similar collection with the items permuted also exists:
      <code>
      <br><br>
      _:c1 rdf:first ex:aaa .<br>
      _:c1 rdf:rest _:c2 .<br>
      _:c2 rdf:first ex:bbb .<br>
      _:c2 rdf:rest rdf:nil . </code></p>

    <p>does not entail</p>

    <p><code>_:c3 rdf:first ex:bbb .<br>
      _:c3 rdf:rest _:c4 .<br>
      <span >_:c4 rdf:first</span> ex:aaa .<br>
     _:c4 rdf:rest rdf:nil .
     </code></p>

    <p>Also, RDF imposes no 'well-formedness' conditions on the use of this
      vocabulary, so that it is possible to write RDF graphs which assert
      the existence of highly peculiar objects such as lists with forked
      or non-list tails, or multiple heads:</p>

    <p><code>_:666 rdf:first ex:aaa .<br>
      _:666 rdf:first ex:bbb .<br>
      _:666 rdf:rest ex:ccc .<br>
      _:666 rdf:rest rdf:nil . </code></p>

    <p>It is also possible to write a set of triples which under-specify a collection
      by failing to specify its <code>rdf:rest</code> property value.</p>

    <p>Semantic extensions may
      place extra syntactic well-formedness restrictions on the use of this vocabulary
      in order to rule out such graphs. They may
      exclude interpretations of the collection vocabulary which violate the convention
      that the subject of a 'linked' collection of two-triple items of the form described
      above, ending with an item ending with <code>rdf:nil</code>, denotes a totally
      ordered sequence whose members are the referents of the <code>rdf:first</code>
      values of the items, in the order got by tracing the <code>rdf:rest</code> properties
      from the subject to <code>rdf:nil</code>. This permits sequences which contain
      other sequences.</p>

    <p> The RDFS semantic conditions require that any
      subject of the <code>rdf:first</code> property, and any subject or object of
      the <code>rdf:rest</code> property, be of <code>rdf:type rdf:List</code>. </p>

  <h2>Triple-term based reification</h2>
  <p>A triple term is a construct defined in the RDF 1.2 Concepts and Abstract 
    Syntax specification [[RDF12-CONCEPTS]], referring to an RDF triple that 
    is used as a value, specifically, in the object position of another triple. 
    Importantly, a triple term does not imply assertion; that is, the triple it 
    denotes is not necessarily asserted in the RDF graph. This enables the 
    representation of metadata or commentary about triples that may or may not 
    be part of the asserted graph content, including potentially contradictory 
    relationships. For a triple term to be considered an asserted triple, it 
    must also appear explicitly in an RDF graph as a top-level triple. Otherwise, 
    it remains unasserted and serves primarily as a reference or subject of metadata.</p>
  <p>A triple term can be the object of a triple whose predicate is 
    <a href="#ch_reifies"><code>rdf:reifies</code></a>. In such cases, the resulting triple is referred 
    to as a reifying triple, and its subject is termed a reifier. The reifier 
    can be used to make further statements about the triple term.</p>

    <h3>Containers</h3>
    <p>RDF containers are resources that are used to represent collections.
      The same resource may appear in a container more than
      once. Unlike containment in the physical world, a container may be
      contained in itself.</p>
    <p>Three different kinds of container are defined. Whilst the formal
      semantics [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]] of all three classes of container are
      identical,
      different classes may be used to indicate informally further
      information. An <code>rdf:Bag</code> is used to indicate that the container is
      intended to be unordered. An <code>rdf:Seq</code> is used to indicate that the
      order indicated by the numerical order of the <a href="#ch_containermembershipproperty">container
        membership properties</a>
      of the container is intended to be significant. An <code>rdf:Alt</code> container
      is used
      to indicate that typical processing of the container will be to select
      one of
      the members.</p>
    <p>Just as a hen house may have the property that it is made of wood,
      that
      does not mean that all the hens it contains are made of wood, a
      property of a
      container is not necessarily a property of all of its members.</p>
<!-- from Semantics doc -->
    <p>RDF provides vocabularies for describing three classes of
      containers. Containers have a type, and their members can
      be enumerated by using a fixed set of <em>container membership
      properties</em>. These properties are indexed by integers to
      provide a way to distinguish the members from each other, but these
      indices should not necessarily be thought of as defining an
      ordering of the container itself; some containers are considered to be unordered.</p>

    <p>The RDFS vocabulary adds a generic membership
      property which holds regardless of position, and classes containing
      all the containers and all the membership properties.</p>

    <p>One should understand this vocabulary as <em>describing</em>
      containers, rather than as a tool for constructing them, as
      would typically be supplied by a programming language. The actual containers are entities in the semantic universe,
      and RDF graphs which use the vocabulary simply provide very basic
      information about these entities, enabling an RDF graph to
      characterize the container type and give partial information about
      the members of a container. Since the RDF container vocabulary is
      so limited, many natural assumptions concerning RDF containers
      cannot be formally sanctioned by the RDF formal semantics. This should not be taken as
      meaning that these assumptions are false, but only that RDF does
      not formally entail that they must be true.</p>

    <p>There are no special semantic conditions on the container
      vocabulary: the only structure which RDF presumes its containers
      to have is what can be inferred from the use of this vocabulary and
      the general RDF semantic conditions. This amounts to knowing the type of a container, and having a partial
      enumeration
      of the items in the container. The intended mode of use is that things
      of type <code>rdf:Bag</code>
      are considered to be unordered but to allow duplicates; things of
      type <code>rdf:Seq</code> are considered to be ordered, and things
      of type <code>rdf:Alt</code> are considered to represent a
      collection of alternatives, possibly with a preference ordering.
      If the container is of an ordered type, then the ordering of items in the container is intended to be
      indicated by the numerical ordering of the container membership
      properties, which are assumed to be single-valued.
      However, these informal conditions are not reflected in any formal RDF
      entailments.</p>


    <p>The RDF semantics does not support any entailments which could arise from enumerating
      the elements of an unordered <code>rdf:Bag</code> in a different order. For example,</p>

    <p><code>_:xxx rdf:type rdf:Bag .<br>
       _:xxx rdf:_1 ex:a .<br>
       _:xxx rdf:_2 ex:b .</code></p>

    <p>does not entail</p>

    <p><code>_:xxx rdf:_1 ex:b .<br>
       _:xxx rdf:_2 ex:a .</code></p>

    <p>(If this c> valid, then the result of
      adding it to the original graph would be entailed by the graph, and this would assert that both elements were in both
      positions. This is a consequence of the fact that RDF is a purely
      assertional language.)</p>

    <p>There is no assumption that a property of a container applies to
      any of the elements of the container, or vice versa. </p>

    <p>There is no formal requirement that
      the three container classes are disjoint, so that for example
      it is consistent to assert that something is both an <code>rdf:Bag</code> and an <code>rdf:Seq</code>.
      There is no assumption that containers are gap-free, so that for example</p>

    <p><code>_:xxx rdf:type rdf:Seq.<br>
       _:xxx rdf:_1 ex:a .<br>
       _:xxx rdf:_3 ex:c .</code></p>

    <p>does not entail</p>

    <p><code>_:xxx rdf:_2 _:yyy .</code></p>

    <p>There is no way in RDF to assert
      that a container contains only a fixed number of members. This is a
      reflection of the fact that it is always consistent to add a triple
      to a graph asserting a membership property of any container. And
      finally, there is no built-in assumption that an RDF container has
      only finitely many members.</p>

    <h3>&quot;Old-style&quot; Reification</h3>

<!-- from Semantics doc -->

    <p>The intended meaning of this vocabulary is to allow an RDF graph to act as metadata describing other RDF triples. </p>

    <p>Consider an example graph containing a single triple:</p>

    <p><code>ex:a ex:b ex:c .</code></p>

    <p>and suppose that IRI <code>ex:graph1</code> is used to identify this graph.
      Exactly how this identification is achieved is external to the RDF model,
      but it might be by the IRI resolving to a concrete syntax document describing the graph,
      or by the IRI being the associated name of a named graph in a dataset.
      Assuming that the IRI can be used to denote the triple,
      then the reification vocabulary allows us to describe the first graph in another graph:</p>

    <p><code>ex:graph1 rdf:type rdf:Statement .<br>
      ex:graph1 rdf:subject ex:a .<br>
      ex:graph1 rdf:predicate ex:b .<br>
      ex:graph1 rdf:object ex:c .</code></p>

    <p>The second graph is called a reification of the triple in the first graph.</p>

    <p>Reification is not a form of quotation. Rather, the reification describes the
      relationship between a token of a triple and the resources that the triple denotes. 
      The value of the <code>rdf:subject</code> property is not the
      subject IRI itself but the thing it denotes, and similarly for <code>rdf:predicate</code> and <code>rdf:object</code>.
      For example, if the referent of <code>ex:a</code> is Mount Everest,
      then the subject of the reified triple is also the mountain, not the IRI which denotes it.</p>

    <p>Reifications can be written with a blank node as subject,
      or with an IRI subject which does not identify any concrete realization of a triple,
      in both of which cases they simply assert the existence of the described triple. </p>

    <p>The subject of a reification is intended to denote a concrete realization of an RDF triple, such as a document in a surface syntax, rather than a triple considered as an abstract object.  This supports use cases where properties such as dates of
      composition or provenance information are applied to the
      reified triple, which are meaningful only when thought of as
      denoting a particular instance or token of a triple. </p>

    <p>A reification of a triple does not entail the triple, and is not entailed by it.
      The reification only says that the triple token exists and what it is about,
      not that it is true, so it does not entail the triple.
      On the other hand, asserting a triple does not automatically imply that any
      triple tokens exist in the universe being described by the triple.
      For example, the triple might be part of an ontology describing
      animals, which could be satisfied by an interpretation in which the
      universe contained only animals, and in which a reification of it was therefore
      false.</p>

    <p>Since the relation between triples and reifications of triples
      in any RDF graph or graphs need not be one-to-one, asserting a
      property about some entity described by a reification need not
      entail that the same property holds of another such entity, even if
      it has the same components. For example,</p>

    <p><code>_:xxx rdf:type rdf:Statement .<br>
      _:xxx rdf:subject ex:subject .<br>
      _:xxx rdf:predicate ex:predicate .<br>
      _:xxx rdf:object ex:object .<br>
      _:yyy rdf:type rdf:Statement .<br>
      _:yyy rdf:subject ex:subject .<br>
      _:yyy rdf:predicate ex:predicate .<br>
      _:yyy rdf:object ex:object .<br>
      _:xxx ex:property ex:foo .</code></p>

    <p>does not entail</p>

    <p><code>_:yyy ex:property ex:foo .</code></p>

    <h3>Acknowledgments for RDF 1.1</h3>
    <p>The current specification is largely an editorial
      clarification of that design, and has benefited greatly from the hard
      work of
      the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/">RDF Core Working Group</a>
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#Membership">members</a>, and
      from
      implementation feedback from many members of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/Interest/">RDF
        Interest Group</a>. In
      2013-2014 Guus Schreiber edited this document on behalf of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/">RDF

  <h2>Change since 2004 Recommendation</h2>
  <p>Changes for RDF 1.1 Recommendation</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Conversion to ReSpec, including formatting of examples and notes.</li>
    <li>References to RDF 1.0 documents where appropriate
      replaced by references to RDF 1.1 documents.</li>
    <li>Replaced the term "URI Reference" with the term "IRI". </li>
    <li>Removed discussion about distinction between plain and typed
      literals, as this distinction is absent in RDF 1.1 and has no
      technical bearing on RDF Schema.</li>
    <li>Removed the introductory paragraph of Sec. <a href="#ch_reificationvocab">"Reification
        Vocabulary"</a>, as this discussion is not related to the
      technical content and is irrelevant and confusing now. </li>
    <li>Update of affiliation of the editors. </li>
    <li>Added RDF WG to the Acknowledgments section.</li>
    <li>Renamed the document from "RDF Vocabulary Description Language
      1.0: RDF Schema" to "RDF Schema 1.1", as the term Vocabulary
      Description Language has led to confusion.</li>
    <li>Three paragraphs of the Introduction were left out. These
      paragraphs described the things that RDF Schema does not do and are
      now much less relevant than in 2004. </li>
    <li>Added the datatypes <code>rdf:langString</code> and <code>rdf:HTML</code>.
    </li>
    <li>Removed Appendix "RDF Schema in RDF/XML". It was informative, but
      now out of date, in terms of content and in terms of
  syntax.</li>
    <li>Marked <code>rdf:HTML</code> and <code>rdf:XMLLiteral</code>
        as non-normative.</li>
    <li>Removed references to 2004 Primer from Secs. 5.1, 5.2
        and 5.4.3. In the latter case the example referred to was
        moved into this document for readability purposes. </li>
